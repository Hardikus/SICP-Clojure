# Readme

This repository holds all of my solutions to the exercises provided in
the [Structure and Interpretation of Computer
Programs](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/) textbook. They have been
completed in the [Clojure programming language](http://clojure.org/).

Please feel free to make use of the solutions for your own study. If
you find any problems with my solutions, it would be great if you
could point them out to me. Improved and enhanced solutions will be
gratefully received. Submit them as pull requests and I'll gladly
merge.
